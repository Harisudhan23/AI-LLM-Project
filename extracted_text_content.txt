This is some text inside of a div block.Remember when you used to wrestle with a pile of their passwords? Those weren't the good old days. We finally have solutions through Single Sign-On (SSO) that will free us from purgatory at the login screen. Yet, with myriad SSO providers, picking the right champion for your organization can feel like trying to escape a maze. Fear not, digital fighters! This guide will arm you with the knowledge to conquer the SSO landscape and find just the perfect solution that suits you. Here, we unveil the Top 10 SSO providers of 2024, their superpowers, and a few considerations:What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user and session authentication mechanism that allows a user to login to multiple applications with one set of credentials and the credentials can be a simple username/password, social login or passwordless authentication. SSO is a relief to users struggling to enter username and passwords multiple applications, every single time they login. This streamlined authentication process enhances user experience and boosts security by reducing the risk of password-related vulnerabilities.Why Do We Need SSO Solutions?End-UserImproved user experience, increased productivity, enhanced security through reduced password management.IT DepartmentReduced password-related support tickets, enhanced security posture, streamlined user provisioning and de-provisioning.Security TeamâStrengthened overall security, reduced risk of data breaches, compliance with industry regulations.ManagementIncreased employee productivity, cost savings through reduced IT support, improved customer satisfaction.10 Best Single Sign-On (SSO) Providers to Enhance Your Security1. Infisign UniFed SSOIn terms of SSO software, Infisign is one of the best single sign-on providers for both workforces (through IAM) and customer-facing platforms (through CIAM).Built on a zero-trust framework, Infisign allows the usage of passwordless authentication, adaptive MFA, automatic logs, conditional access, and Privileged Access Management (PAM) based on policies that you set for complete security. This software also comes with directory sync without hidden costs (which is not the case with most SSO software). This not only makes it a lot more affordable but also, allows you to integrate your existing tech stack easily especially since it comes with over 6000+ apps and SDKs for better integration.What makes Infisign the best SSO provider on this list? Well, put simply itâs the fact that it comes with AI access assist - a feature that automates access requests based on roles and policies you decide. But more than this it comes at a much more reasonable price point compared to its competitors.Key Features in Infisign SSO:Â Passwordless Authentication: Built on a ZTF framework, Infisign allows you to authenticate your users without the use or exchange of passwords making it hackerproof and a lot more challenging to take over or breach.Adaptive MFA: Aside from having SSO, Infisign allows the use of adaptive MFA parallelly meaning you can add biometrics, OTPs, device passkeys, push notifications, or even email magic links.ABAC: This allows you to automate access based on roles or attributes you decide like email IDs, DOJs, or departments. Imagine RBAC but a level deeper.Instant Audit Readiness + Data Compliance: With automatic recording of user logs, changes, and PAM in place you are always audit-ready and data compliant.Â Instant Provisioning and Deprovisioning: Add and remove users to a number of tools with just a few clicks.AI Access Assist: This automates access permissions and also allows you to accept or deny requests quickly through Slack and MS Teams.2. OktaThe wise old sage of SSO, Okta, offers a comprehensive SSO solution with advanced features like multi-factor authentication and user lifecycle management. Think of them as your powerful and experienced Gandalf. Bonus: Tons of integrations make them super versatile. Drawback: The pricing can get complex for big organizations, so read the fine print!3. Microsoft Azure ADCalling all Microsoft devotees! Azure AD plugs seamlessly into all your favorite Microsoft products, so it's a bit of a no-brainer for those who already live and breathe in the Microsoft ecosystem. It's your knight in shining armorâperfectly attuned to guarding your Microsoft kingdom. Bonus: Seamlessly integrated Microsoft will send some people into rapture. Watch out: Power users may be underwhelmed by the lack of customization options.4. Ping IdentityFor all security fanatics, Ping Identity offers an enterprise solution with muscular access control and user management. Think of them as your stoic guardianâwatchful and vigilant. Strength: Granular control keeps the bad guys out. Weakness: Setting it up might require a little bit more elbow grease than other user-friendly options.5. Auth0Cloud-based and developer-friendly, Auth0 is programmer-favorite. Think of them like your tech-savvy ninjaâagile and full of neat developer tools. Agility: Easy to use and integrates with pretty much everything. Notice: More complex access control requirements may be needed to configure.6. AWS IAMGreat for organizations already heavily invested in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. AWS IAM is a good way of keeping track of who can do what with AWS resources: think of it as your security guard, protecting the digital vault to which only authorized personnel can gain entryâPro: Inexpensive for AWS environments. Cons: Not as feature-rich as more extensive SSO solutions, so think outside the AWS box if you need more.7. ForgeRockAdvanced security features provided by ForgeRock include adaptive authentication and user behavior analytics, just to name a few. Imagine it as your high-tech security system that will always detect and be ready for changes in threats.Powerhouse: Advanced security features position you one step ahead of the bad guys. Price Tag: Expect to shell out a little more for this top-of-the-line protection.8. KeycloakThis is an open-source, highly configurable application that devs love to get their hands dirty with. Consider these the open-source sorcerer; you'll have ultimate power over your SSO. Mastery: Maximum customization options fit for the tech-savvy. Mystique: Takes more technical know-how to get set up and managed, so dust off your coding hat.9. Gluu ServerAnother open-source entry, Gluu Server provides core single sign-on functionalities like multi-factor authentication and user self-service. It's your dependable workhorseâall essentials at a good value. Open Door Policy: Part of the power of the open-source model is that it's easy to deploy. Feature Lite: Relative to commercial options, the feature set might be a bit slim.10. OneLoginSecurity is the middle name of OneLogin. They offer features like adaptive authentication and risk-based access control to ensure your data is always safe. Think of them like that vigilant guard dog, sniffing for any potential security threat.Security First: Strong security features provide peace of mind. Learning Curve: Their user interface may take a bit to get used to compared with competitors.Remember, the "best" SSO provider depends on your unique needs. Consider your budget, existing infrastructure, user base, and desired security features.How to Choose an Ideal SSO Provider for Your Business?Selecting the optimal Single Sign-On (SSO) provider is pivotal for bolstering your organization's security posture, enhancing user experience, and streamlining operations.
